#+title: Contributing

* Coding style
(To be done)
* Development procedure
This outlines the steps you will need to take to contribute to Cleanse.
1. Do not commit on the ~master~ branch. Instead, checkout a new branch and make
   your commits there. You can make as many branches as you need. Some
   additional notes on committing:
   - Commit messages must be worded in the imperative mood. For example: "Add
     CONTRIBUTING.org file". You can also add a description to the commit for
     additional explanation.
   - Additionally, specify the files that the commit affects are located. For
     example: "data/textures: add player textures" if the commit in question is
     adding textures to ~/data/textures~.
   - Use ~git add -p~ to choose which hunks to stage for commit, and make your
     commits look cleaner.
2. Use ~git format-patch~ to convert your commits into patch files that can be
   easily sent to the maintainer (ydalton in this case).
